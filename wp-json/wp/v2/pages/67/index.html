There they were brought to a living relationship with Jesus Christ and to renewal in the power of the Holy Spirit through a series of weekly informal discussions of the gospel in a social environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning from the first 16 couples who joined the weekly gathering, CFC became a Christian family life renewal which was later made available to parishes and groups of married couples who wished to live out their Christian life in an active supportive relationship with one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The growth of CFC stemmed from its heart for mission and evangelization and its commitment to sharing God\u2019s love with others, beginning from the basic unit \u2013 the family.&nbsp; It did not take long for CFC to realize that while a couple renewal was essential, it would be incomplete without family renewal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.couplesforchristglobal.org\/famin.aspx\">RELATED ARTICLE: Family Ministries<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the years, CFC has blossomed into a worldwide ministry, becoming a major force for the renewal of the Christian family life and also of the church.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.couplesforchristglobal.org\/history.aspx\">RELATED ARTICLE: CFC Historical Timeline<\/a><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>WHY SUCH A MINISTRY?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CFC wants to rise in defense of the family, which is God\u62af work.
